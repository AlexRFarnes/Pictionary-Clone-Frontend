## General info

This is a clone of the Pictionary game where multiple persons can join a room. When all persons are ready one is picked at random to be the drawer. The project implements socket.io on the backend to create these rooms and allow for the users to communicate. In the frontend, the canvas HTML element is used for the drawings.
